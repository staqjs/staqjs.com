title: PrivateRoute
---

A wrapper around `<Route>` that will render its component argument if the user is signed in, and redirect to /signin otherwise.

The arguments to `PrivateRoute` are the same as those to `Route`, except render cannot be used with `PrivateRoute`.

```jsx
// Create a publicly accessible landing page, and a user settings page that
// can only be accessed once a user is logged in

import { PrivateRoute } from '@staqjs/client'

...

return (
  <Router>
    <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
    <PrivateRoute path="/user-settings" component={UserSettingsPage} />
  </Router>
)
```
