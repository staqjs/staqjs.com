# What

Staq is a Javascript library for creating Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products. It works with React, Firebase, and Stripe to abstract away all the boring parts of building software people pay you for.

The library contains a set of React components that implement standard SaaS features including:

- User accounts
- Landing page
- Pricing page
- Billing and subscription management

Staq also ships with a set of NodeJS functions to be used with Firebase to implement the backend logic necessary for features like subscription billing with Stripe.

# Why

We believe it should be as easy as possible to start making money online. We believe owning and running a profitable software business will increasingly become the best way for individuals to reach financial independence.

But right now it takes too long to set up the technology to power a simple SaaS company. Even for engineers who know what they’re doing and are familiar with existing tools.

We’re building Staq to fix that.
