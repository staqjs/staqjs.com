The client-side library, @staqjs/client, provides templates for your marketing website, components for common features like sign up, sign in and password reset, and helper functions for interacting with the server and the database.

Note: If you don’t have a Stripe account or don’t want to enable payments, you can skip the payments configuration in index.js and the entire Server section.
